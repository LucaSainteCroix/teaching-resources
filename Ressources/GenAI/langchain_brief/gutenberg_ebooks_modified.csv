155,164,152,"Sprague, Ruth M.",Wild Justice,,"""WILD JUSTICE"" by Ruth M. Sprague is a fiction novel written in the early 1990s. The book centers on the plight of Professor Diana Trenchant, who faces an unjust termination hearing after being accused of falsifying student evaluations while the university administration appears to condone far worse offenses among its male faculty. Through a blend of humor and indignation, Sprague seeks to expose the systematic sexism ingrained in academic institutions and the often disingenuous practices that protect the status quo.  At the start of the story, readers are introduced to Diana Trenchant, an experienced professor who is shocked to find herself at the center of a termination hearing instigated by the committee at Belmont University. The opening chapters set the stage for her defense, revealing the skewed dynamics between faculty and administration, as well as the petty motivations driving the accusations against her. Key administrators, such as Henry Tarbuck and Lyle Stone, are depicted as self-serving figures aiming to discredit Trenchant while maintaining their own questionable positions. Other characters, like Professor Jonathan Bambridge, serve as a reminder of the complicity often found in academia. As the hearing unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that Diana's case is less about her actions and more about entrenched gender biases and institutional power struggles.

An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government"" by P. J. Proudhon is a philosophical and political treatise written in the early 19th century.

Proudhon famously states, ""Property is theft,"" suggesting that the institution of private property is fundamentally unjust and a source of societal inequality.  At the start of the work, Proudhon introduces the central theme of his investigation: the nature of property and its implications for justice and governance. He first proposes that commonly accepted definitions of property, whether based on labor or law, fail to hold when subjected to rigorous analysis. By asserting that property is an effect without a cause, he calls into question the foundations of societal consent and legal structures surrounding ownership. Proudhon's method seeks to dissect these concepts, aiming to demonstrate that true justice and equality must replace existing legal and economic frameworks. The opening chapters promise a critical examination of entrenched societal beliefs, inviting readers to reconsider their views on property and the principles governing human interaction.

The book is a foundational work in the field of Western philosophy, particularly known for its exploration of metaphysics and ethics. Spinoza examines the nature of God, existence, and reality, offering a rational understanding of the universe that intertwines his moral philosophy with his metaphysical views.  In ""Part 1: Concerning God,"" Spinoza lays out his definitions, axioms, and propositions regarding the nature of God and substance. He argues that God is an absolutely infinite being whose essence necessarily includes existence. He posits that there cannot be two substances with the same attributes and that everything that exists does so through God, asserting that all things depend on the divine for their essence and existence. Spinoza further contends that God's will is not free in the human sense but is bound by the necessity of his nature, driving home the idea that everything in the universe unfolds according to divine laws rather than random chance. This work challenges traditional views of God and existence, positioning Spinoza as a pivotal figure in the development of philosophical thought.

The text suggests that the human mind is inherently connected to the body, perceiving and understanding through the modifications that arise from their interaction, setting the stage for deeper explorations of consciousness, knowledge, and perception in subsequent propositions.

Dickens emphasizes the importance of allowing all individuals the right to enjoy their free time without unnecessary moral judgment, arguing for a more compassionate understanding of human nature and the need for joy in life.

The goal of this analysis is to empower individuals to recognize the sources of their emotions, argue that true freedom lies in understanding those sources, and suggests that by controlling our understanding of emotions, we can achieve a more rational life.

He begins by outlining the rights and responsibilities of juries as defined by the Common Law and the Magna Carta, advocating that juries must have the authority to judge the justice of laws. Spooner insists that if a jury is unable to exercise its fundamental right to evaluate whether a law is just or unjust, then the very concept of trial by jury becomes meaningless and merely becomes a tool for governmental oppression. He lays a foundation for a broader discussion that will unfold throughout the essay, critiquing contemporary judicial practices and asserting the necessity for juries to remain independent from government influence.

He argues that tragedy evokes profound emotions by presenting a noble character's downfall due to a tragic flaw (hamartia) and emphasizes the role of plot over character in creating impactful narratives. By defining essential components of tragedy, including the elements of recognition and reversal, as well as evaluating epic poetry, Aristotle lays the groundwork for the analysis of literature that continues to influence literary criticism to this day.
